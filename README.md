## Background/objective: 

We are working as an analyst for a real estate company. The ompany wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. We will also be exploring the data to better undestand with with set questions and present the data visually. 

## Data:

The data set consists of information on some 22,000 properties.  The dataset consisted of historic data of houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015.



### We will try to achieve this in 3 chapters based on the tools used:

***Python***: Dataset explore and processing with intent to build several machine learning models to predict housing values. 

***Variables Description**
- id - Identification
- date - Date sold
- price - Sale price
- bedrooms - Number of bedrooms
- bathrooms - Number of bathrooms
- sqft_liv - Size of living area in square feet
- sqft_lot - Size of the lot in square feet
- floors - Number of floors
- waterfront - ‘1’ if the property has a waterfront, ‘0’ if not.
- view - An index from 0 to 4 of how good the view of the property was
- condition - Condition of the house, ranked from 1 to 5
- grade - Classification by construction quality which refers to the types of materials used and the quality of workmanship. Buildings of better quality (higher grade) cost more to build per unit of measure and command higher value.
- sqft_above - Square feet above ground
- sqft_basmt - Square feet below ground
- yr_built - Year built
- yr_renov - Year renovated. ‘0’ if never renovated
- zipcode - 5 digit zip code
- lat - Latitude
- long - Longitude
- squft_liv15 - Average size of interior housing living space for the closest 15 houses, in - square feet
- squft_lot15 - Average size of land lots for the closest 15 houses, in square feet
